### 🍎 Game Title: BodyQuest

**Genre:** Simulation / Educational Adventure / Health Awareness
**Team Members:** Itzhak Bista, Adir Ofir

### 🕹️ Short Description

BodyQuest is an interactive simulation game where players embark on an adventure inside the human body. You control a small, friendly explorer who travels through organs, arteries, and systems — trying to keep the body healthy by balancing food, exercise, and rest.
Your decisions determine how the body reacts: eat junk food and your energy drops, sleep too little and focus fades, keep an active lifestyle and the body becomes stronger.

The goal isn’t to preach about health, but to make learning about it fun and natural through gameplay.

### 💡 Key Features

* A living 3D world inside the human body.
* Dynamic health stats that change based on your decisions.
* Mini-games for digestion, heart rate balance, and exercise.
* Educational content disguised as gameplay challenges.

### 🧠 Learning Objective

To teach healthy habits and body awareness through interactive choices and consequences, without overt instructions or lessons.

### 1. **Game Concept**

BodyQuest transforms the human body into an explorable world. The player’s mission is to help the body maintain balance — ensuring that nutrients, energy, and rest are properly managed. The game combines biology concepts with fun tasks and decision-making, encouraging curiosity and self-learning.

### 2. **Gameplay Mechanics**

* **Core Loop:** Explore → Make daily health choices → Observe body reactions → Complete organ challenges → Level up.
* **Player Stats:**

  * **Energy:** affected by sleep, food, and exercise.
  * **Mood:** impacted by sugar levels and stress.
  * **Health Bar:** represents the body’s general state; improves with balanced choices.

### 3. **Game Systems and Challenges**

* **Food Selection:** choose between fast food, fruits, or balanced meals. Each affects digestion speed and energy.
* **Exercise Missions:** mini-games like running through veins (to boost circulation) or stretching muscles in rhythm.
* **Sleep Cycles:** the player must schedule rest to avoid “body fatigue” events.
* **Infection Events:** bacteria and viruses appear as small enemies that can only be defeated if your immune level is high.

### 4. **Aesthetic and Art Style**

* 3D or 2.5D environment with glowing colors and fluid motion.
* Each organ is a unique biome (e.g., Heart = factory, Brain = control room, Stomach = bubbling lava pit).
* Soundtrack changes based on health state — calm when healthy, tense when unhealthy.

### 5. **Examples of Game Processes**

* **Process 1 – The Sugar Rush:** After eating too many sweets, the body speeds up but crashes quickly. The player must stabilize sugar levels by finding “fiber zones.”
* **Process 2 – Sleep Recovery:** Completing a puzzle mini-game helps the body “recharge” and restore focus.
* **Process 3 – Virus Attack:** A timed event where immune cells must be guided to fight bacteria — a mix of action and strategy.

### 6. **Market Research**

* Similar Games: *Human: Fall Flat (tone)*, *Spore (biological exploration)*, *Plague Inc. (body systems)*, *Kerbal EDU*.
* Target Audience: Teens and young adults who enjoy casual simulation games with a meaningful twist.
* Unique Value: Merges science learning with gamified decision-making and emotional feedback.

### 7. **Learning Integration**

Learning is built into the player’s curiosity — not through text or lectures.

* Players discover cause and effect (e.g., unhealthy choices lead to fatigue).
* Encourages experimentation: “What happens if I skip breakfast?”
* Reinforces the idea of balance rather than perfection.
